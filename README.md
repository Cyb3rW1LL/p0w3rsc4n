### The not-so lightweight Powershell version of Nmap
#### (*This tool is still in development*)
#### Requires powershell 7+ due to "PSParallel" use (not compatible with ISE)
#### The three initial capabilities provide:
> 1. Batch job TCP Scanning
> 2. Batch job UDP Scanning
> 3. OS fingerprinting based on ttl
